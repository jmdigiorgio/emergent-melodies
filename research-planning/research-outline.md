# Research Outline: Emergent Melodies

Of every piano composition that could ever exist, how many have been brought to lifeâ€”and what undiscovered masterpieces await their debut?

## Research Overview

This project explores the vast space of possible piano compositions to understand the relationship between existing musical works and the theoretical space of all possible musical combinations. We aim to investigate:

1. The mathematical boundaries of possible piano compositions
2. The characteristics that make certain musical patterns more "meaningful" than others
3. The intersection of music theory, combinatorics, and human perception

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the mathematical space of all possible piano compositions?
2. Within this space, what distinguishes "musical" sequences from random ones?
3. How do human perception and cultural context influence which regions of this space are considered meaningful?
4. What portion of the total possible space has been explored by existing compositions?
5. How much unexplored space is left in piano composition?
6. How long might it take to explore the remaining space?

## Methodology Approach

1. Mathematical Framework
   - Define the mathematical representation of piano compositions
   - Calculate the size and dimensions of the total possible space
   - Identify key constraints (physical, temporal, notational)

2. Analysis of Existing Works
   - Survey existing piano compositions
   - Map them into our mathematical framework
   - Identify patterns and clusters in the explored space

3. Cultural and Perceptual Analysis
   - Study how musical meaning emerges from mathematical patterns
   - Examine cultural factors in what's been explored vs ignored
   - Project potential timeframes for future exploration

## Project Goals

1. Develop a formal framework for analyzing the space of possible piano compositions
2. Create tools for exploring and visualizing this musical space
3. Identify patterns and principles that characterize "meaningful" music
4. Generate and evaluate novel compositions from unexplored regions
