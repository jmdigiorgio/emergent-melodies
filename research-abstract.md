# Emergent Melodies: Exploring the Mathematical Space of Piano Composition

## Background

Of every piano composition that could ever exist, how many have been brought to life? The space of possible piano compositions is vast but finite, bounded by physical and temporal constraints.

## Objective

This research aims to quantify and characterize the total mathematical space of possible piano compositions, determine what portion has been explored through existing works, and estimate the scope of unexplored musical territory.

## Methods

We will develop or rely upon an existing mathematical framework to represent piano compositions, analyze existing works within this framework, and study how musical meaning emerges from mathematical patterns. The research combines combinatorial analysis with music theory and cultural musicology.

## Expected Outcomes

This study aims to provide a comprehensive mapping of the possible space of piano compositions, offering insights into musical creativity, cultural patterns in composition, and the vast territory of unexplored musical possibilities.

## Significance

Understanding the mathematical boundaries of piano composition could reveal new perspectives on musical creativity and challenge our assumptions about musical innovation.
